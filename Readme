Run the command "make" to create the binaries 

./step1 is a binary which takes in the xml file as an argument and saves the index of the xml file in ./data/ folder.

./query is a binary which takes in an xml file as an argument and outputs the Document IDs in which the query is present

"make clean" removes all the binaries

As specified in the assignment I have created index.sh install.sh query.sh
